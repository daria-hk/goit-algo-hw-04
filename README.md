1. Insertion-sort execution time: 0.029530250001698732 sek
2. Merge-sort execution time: 0.13636399999813875 sek
3. Timsort-sort execution time: 0.009618832998967264 sek
> Based on the reported execution times, "Timsort" appears to be the fastest sorting method, followed by "Insertion-Sort" and then "Merge-Sort".
> It is important to note that the actual performance of these sorting algorithms depends on various factors such as the size of the input, the type of data, and the implementation.
